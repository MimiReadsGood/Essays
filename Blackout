\title BLACKOUT

I first heard about the eclipse a year ago. It was a once in a lifetime event. Headlines like that circulate. But I looked and sure enough, it was.

afterward, the coverage had differing totals. Last seen 85 years ago. Not seen since 72 years ago.

I remember the picture of earth sent from somewhere beneath the rings of Saturn. It's hard to conjure the sense of awe, the wonder and delight of a planetary selfie some 9.5AUs from us -- that is 9.5 times farther than we are on earth.

Walking to the premiere, I found myself thrilled to see the fans in character. Some more skillful than others in wardrobe but the dedication was abundant.

When the movie ends, I feel a sense of loss. I know this is why it connected. That I connected. 

Who knew math camp was a thing?

The teacher posed his question. Half a dozen hands shoot up. The teacher points to each student by name in sequence. The opinions roll off student by student. We did this like we'd always known to do this. Like answering in mass form was how everyone was taught. But no, this was the first lesson. It involves self-control, remembering your place in line, and the confidence to speak. Long gone are the memories of students eagerly waving their hands. The orderly procession of replies continue. As on student completes their thought, the next student waits in queue. I do not notice the jarring disconnect of the real world until I arrive at college. Hands shoot up less confidently. But the replies come one by one -- slowly and with prompting.

Like the many dreams where an unknown starship carried me vast distances, far from everything I know. I feel fear, the exhilaration of the unknown, the palpable aloneness of being completely cut off. The landmass schematics are unrecognizable. the names are unreadable. I have no idea what I will find.

It also makes you wonder what home actually means. Does home mean family? How many of them does it take? If you're with your mom, are you home? Does it take both parents, siblings, cousins? How many? What if you're in a new town, at a reunion, vacation?


But isn't that living? What is life if not to experience newness or to explore or see? Is repeating the same routine life?
