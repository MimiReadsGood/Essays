\title BLACKOUT

I first heard about the eclipse a year ago. It was a once in a lifetime event. Headlines like that circulated. So I looked and sure enough, it was. The next time a full eclipse splashed its shadow across the lower 48, I would be long dead. Te moon moves across the path of sun all the time. But those paths cross places like the middle of the Pacific where humans are likely to be.

Hotels filled up along the path of totality, where the sun would be in total blackness. From Oregon in the West to the Carolinas, campsites and podunk towns prepared for the influx of geeks with an astronomical bent. Some towns didn't believe the hype. Others didn't get what they expected.

The morning of the eclipse, I took my usual train into Seattle. Despite being far from the path of totality, the air felt crisper. Something was electric. When I stepped into the rooftop party, I was pleasantly surprised. The downtown roofdeck overlooking the Sound was packed with engineers and fellow science nerds. Eclipse glasses made of paper and industrial tin foil were handed out. The more industrious made their own pinhole viewers. 

I was home. 

Rows and rows of humans gawked at the clear sky. Eclipses are mundane on a galactic scale, but on a human scale, it was holy. As the moon blocked sunlight, the air temperature dropped in minute degrees too smalled to be noticed. Visible light dimmed to twilight levels. The edge of moon was crisp against the solar backdrop. And over the course of 30 minutes, it slid across the face of the sun, blocking about 80% of it at maximum.

I witness history.

I looked around the rooftop. So many different conversations occurred. But mostly, people took those moments to watch silently as the moon followed its normal path through space about a quarter millions miles away. One young female engineer never took her eyes from the sky, eclipse glasses secured against her face. I smiled. I understood. 

I didn't want to leave. I wanted to remember. I wanted to stay in that moment. Moments where I knew I belonged. 

I remember the other times. Times I didn't question that I belonged. When I was 13 and inducted into a place called MathCamp. Yes, there was a real place called MathCamp. On the University of Arizona campus, I spent a weekend with a small group of middle school kids studying things like Fibonacci numbers and recursive algorithms. I played speed chess for the first time. We had late night access to the cafeteria where soft serve ice cream flowed freely. We posed for silly pictures and became instant friends.

Then there was the selfie from under the rings of Saturn. The Cassini spacecraft had traveled for years. It finally arrived. And one of the images sent back was from the far side of that gas giant. A clever human annotated an arrow on the black parts of the image, pointing at a small bluish dot -- Earth.

That moment literally took my breath away.

I was standing somewhere beneath the rings of Saturn. They were vibrant. Brilliant. I was 9.5AUs from the sun -- that is 9.5 times farther away from the sun than usual. I'm surrounded mostly by black and a looming planet that occupies the majority of my vision. And far away in the vastness of inky space, a blue dot flows by carrying a few billion humans. This is the first time we see ourselves from a distance. Other crafts have gone farther, but they've never sent back a color picture of our miniscule home represented simply by a point of light.

The moment conjures an awe I rarely experience. I felt it on the rooftop watching an eclipse with fellow science lovers. It is easy to believe we're the apex of evolution. It's easy to think there's no other life out there, at least other life within human reach. It is human habit to focus on our own importance. That our big blue globe is the only thing that matters. And we war among ourselves to carve out resources for ourselves. 

This is the unfortunate state of the human condition. But when those few precious moments come, I soak myself in the galactice perspective. I stand under the icy rings of Saturn. I orbit the poles of Jupiter. I snap photos of the hexagonal storms whirring away at the norther pole of Neptune. And once in a while, my fellow nerds join me in that moment of reverence. 

I am home.
